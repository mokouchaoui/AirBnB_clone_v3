irBnB clone - RESTful API Python Back-end API Webserver Flask Cohort

The AirBnB Clone project at Holberton School comprises multiple segments aimed at covering fundamental concepts of higher-level programming.
The initial segment, known as "The Console," focuses on creating a command interpreter to manage objects for the AirBnB website (HBnB).
This interpreter allows users to perform various functionalities such as creating new objects (e.g., users or places), retrieving objects 
from files or databases, performing operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing stats), updating attributes of objects, and destroying objects.
The console serves as the entry point of the command interpreter and supports a list of commands detailed in the console.py file.
The project environment involves Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Python 3.4.3. Installation instructions and usage guidelines are provided for both interactive and non-interactive modes.
